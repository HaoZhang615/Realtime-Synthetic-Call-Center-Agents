The multi-agent system supports internal knowledge base queries, web search (grounded by Bing Search), and database actions (read, create, update), making it ideal for showcasing AI-driven customer support and automation in call centers and retail environments.

## Security & Networking

This solution supports **enterprise-grade security** with configurable Zero Trust architecture. During deployment with `azd up`, users can choose to enable Zero Trust networking for enhanced security:

### Zero Trust Architecture (Optional - Selected During Deployment) (**Work In Progress**) 
The `azd up` deployment process allows users to decide whether to enable Zero Trust architecture. When enabled:
- **All public endpoints are disabled** except for the AI Foundry/AI Services account (required for AI Search indexing skillset functionality)
- **Virtual Network (VNet) Integration**: Container Apps Environment deployed with VNet integration using workload profiles
- **Private Endpoints**: Backend services (Azure Storage, Cosmos DB, Azure AI Search, Key Vault) communicate privately through dedicated private endpoints
- **Private DNS Zones**: Custom DNS resolution ensures services resolve to private IP addresses within the VNet
- **Network Security**: Backend services deny public access and only allow communication through private endpoints
- **AI Services Exception**: The AI Foundry/AI Services account maintains public access and key-based authentication for AI Search compatibility

### Standard Deployment (Default)
When Zero Trust is not enabled:
- Services use public endpoints with managed identity authentication
- Simplified networking while maintaining security through RBAC and managed identities
- Easier troubleshooting and development workflows

### Authentication & Authorization
- **User-Assigned Managed Identity**: Single managed identity used across all Azure services for secure, keyless authentication
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Granular permissions assigned to the managed identity for each service
- **Azure Key Vault**: Secure storage for sensitive configuration like API keys
- **Azure Trusted Services**: Storage account configured to allow trusted Azure services (like AI Search) access

## üöÄ Local Development

### Quick Start (All Services)
```powershell
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/HaoZhang615/Realtime-Synthetic-Call-Center-Agents.git
cd Realtime-Synthetic-Call-Center-Agents

# 2. Login to Azure
az login
azd auth login

# 3. Deploy (one command!)
azd up

# Choose deployment option when prompted:
# - Standard (public endpoints) - Default, easier for testing
# - Zero Trust (private endpoints) - Enterprise security

# 4. After deployment, manually connect Bing Search in AI Foundry Portal
# (Required for Web Search Agent - see post-deployment steps below)
```

**Deployment creates:**
- Container Apps (Frontend + Backend)
- Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o Realtime, GPT-4.1-nano, text-embedding-3-large)
- Azure AI Search (hybrid + semantic search)
- Cosmos DB (synthetic data storage)
- Azure Storage (document ingestion)
- Azure AI Foundry (web search agent)
- Key Vault (secrets management)
- Optional: VNet + Private Endpoints (Zero Trust mode)

### Post-Deployment Steps

> [!NOTE]
> **Email Setup** - To enable outbound email functionality, authorize your M365 account:
> See [Email Authorization Guide](./docs/mail_authorisation.md)

### Using the Application

```powershell
# Get deployed URLs from azd output
azd env get-values | Select-String "FRONTEND_URL|BACKEND_URL"
```

**Admin Portal** (`FRONTEND_URL`):
1. **Upload Tab**: Upload PDF/DOCX/TXT documents to knowledge base
2. **Files Tab**: Manage uploaded documents
3. **Synthetic Data Tab**: Generate test customers, products, and conversations
4. **Dashboard Tab**: View statistics and conversation sentiment

**Voice Chat**:
- Click "Chat" in sidebar to start voice conversation
- Select a customer profile to log in
- Choose your preferred voice
- Ask questions about documents, products, or web search queries

**Sample Questions:**
- "Check my customer information"
- "Change my address to [street, city, postal code, country]"
- "What products are available in your catalog?"
- "I want to order 2 units of [product name]"
- "Send me an email confirming my order"
- "Tell me about [topic from uploaded document]"
- "What's the latest news about [topic]?"

## üíª Local Development

### Start All Services

```powershell
# Starts MCP Server (8888), Backend (8000), Frontend (5173)
.\start-local-dev.ps1

# Check status
.\status-local-dev.ps1

# Stop all
.\stop-local-dev.ps1
```

**Service URLs:**
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000/docs
- MCP Server: http://localhost:8888/health

### Targeted Deployment

```powershell
# Deploy only frontend changes
azd deploy frontend

# Deploy only backend changes
azd deploy backend
```

## How to get it work

1. Access the backend FastAPI admin interface at the backend URL from the output of `azd up`.
2. Access the React frontend at the frontend URL from the output of `azd up` process
3. In the "Admin Portal" page:
-     Use the "Upload" tab in the admin interface to upload documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT) to populate the internal knowledge base
![Admin_Upload](docs/images/frontend_admin_upload.png)
-     Use the "Files" tab in the admin interface to verify the documents have been indexed and delete any unwanted files

-     Use the "Synthetic Data" tab in the admin interface to create synthetic customers, products, purchases histories and customer conversations
![Admin_SyntheticData](docs/images/frontend_admin_systheticdata.png)
-     Use the "Dashboard" tab in the admin interface to overview on the setup status and synthetic customer conversations by topic, product and agents.

![Admin_Dashboard_Data](docs/images/frontend_admin_dashboard_check_humanconversation.png)
4. In the "Voice Chat" page:
-     Choose one of the (synthesized) customer names to log in
![Frontend_Login](docs/images/frontend_voice_chat_customer_selection.png)
-     Select the voice you want to use and click on the microphone button to start voice interaction
![Frontend_VoiceSelection](docs/images/frontend_voice_chat_choose_voice.png)
-     Speak to interact with the AI assistant
