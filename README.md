The multi-agent system supports internal knowledge base queries, web search (grounded by Bing Search), and database actions (read, create, update), making it ideal for showcasing AI-driven customer support and automation in call centers and retail environments.

## Security & Networking

This solution supports **enterprise-grade security** with configurable Zero Trust architecture. During deployment with `azd up`, users can choose to enable Zero Trust networking for enhanced security:

### Zero Trust Architecture (Optional - Selected During Deployment) (**Work In Progress**) 
The `azd up` deployment process allows users to decide whether to enable Zero Trust architecture. When enabled:
- **All public endpoints are disabled** except for the AI Foundry/AI Services account (required for AI Search indexing skillset functionality)
- **Virtual Network (VNet) Integration**: Container Apps Environment deployed with VNet integration using workload profiles
- **Private Endpoints**: Backend services (Azure Storage, Cosmos DB, Azure AI Search, Key Vault) communicate privately through dedicated private endpoints
- **Private DNS Zones**: Custom DNS resolution ensures services resolve to private IP addresses within the VNet
- **Network Security**: Backend services deny public access and only allow communication through private endpoints
- **AI Services Exception**: The AI Foundry/AI Services account maintains public access and key-based authentication for AI Search compatibility

### Standard Deployment (Default)
When Zero Trust is not enabled:
- Services use public endpoints with managed identity authentication
- Simplified networking while maintaining security through RBAC and managed identities
- Easier troubleshooting and development workflows

### Authentication & Authorization
- **User-Assigned Managed Identity**: Single managed identity used across all Azure services for secure, keyless authentication
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Granular permissions assigned to the managed identity for each service
- **Azure Key Vault**: Secure storage for sensitive configuration like API keys
- **Azure Trusted Services**: Storage account configured to allow trusted Azure services (like AI Search) access

## How to get it work

- [Deploy the application](#how-to-deploy)
1. Access the backend FastAPI admin interface at the backend URL from the output of `azd up`.
2. Access the React frontend at the frontend URL from the output of `azd up` process

## How to deploy

### Prerequisites

#### Tool Dependencies
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli): `az` - For Azure resource management
- [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview): `azd` - For streamlined deployment
- [Python 3.12+](https://www.python.org/downloads/): `python` - Backend runtime
- [UV Package Manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/): `uv` - Fast Python dependency management
- [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/): `node` and `npm` - Frontend build tools
- Optionally [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/): `docker` - For local container testing

#### Azure Permissions Required

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: This deployment requires **subscription-level permissions** due to resource group creation, managed identity provisioning, and role assignments.

The deploying user must have **one of the following** at the subscription level:

1. **Owner role** (Recommended)
   - Full access to create and manage all resources
   - Can assign roles to managed identities

2. **Contributor + User Access Administrator roles**
   - Contributor: Create and manage Azure resources
   - User Access Administrator: Assign roles for managed identity authentication

3. **Custom role** with these specific permissions:
   ```json
   {
     "permissions": [
       {
         "actions": [
           "Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/write",
           "Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write", 
           "Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/read",
           "Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/*/action",
           "Microsoft.Resources/deployments/*",
           "*"
         ]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

**Why subscription-level permissions are needed:**
- Creates a new resource group (if not specified)
- Provisions user-assigned managed identity
- Assigns RBAC roles across multiple Azure services (Storage, AI Search, Cosmos DB, Key Vault)
- Deploys infrastructure with subscription-scoped Bicep template

### Deployment and setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/HaoZhang615/Realtime-Synthetic-Call-Center-Agents.git
cd .\Realtime-Synthetic-Call-Center-Agents\
azd up
```

During the `azd up` process, you will be prompted to decide whether to enable **Zero Trust architecture**. When enabled, all public endpoints (except the AI Foundry/AI Services account) will be disabled for enhanced security.

The deployment process automatically provisions:
- **Azure Container Apps Environment** with optional VNet integration and workload profiles
- **AI Foundry Project** with Bing Search grounding connection
- **MCP Server** for AI Foundry agent integration (internal ingress only)
- **Private networking** with VNet, private endpoints, and DNS zones for backend services (when Zero Trust is enabled)
- **Managed identity** with appropriate RBAC permissions across all services
- **Secure storage** configuration with trusted services access for AI Search indexing
- **Model deployments** for GPT-4o Realtime, GPT-4.1-nano, and text-embedding-3-large

#### Zero Trust Architecture Features

When Zero Trust is enabled during deployment:
- **Private Endpoints**: Azure Storage, Cosmos DB, Azure AI Search, and Key Vault communicate through private endpoints only
- **Network Isolation**: Backend services deny public access and only allow communication through the VNet
- **AI Services Exception**: The AI Foundry/AI Services account maintains public access and key-based authentication to ensure compatibility with AI Search operations
- **Container Apps**: Deployed with VNet integration for secure communication with backend services

[!NOTE]
>Once deployed, you need to authorise the solution to use your M365 email account for the outbound email capability.
> [Authorise mail access](./docs/mail_authorisation.md)

>[!IMPORTANT]
>**Manual Configuration Required: Bing Search Connection**
>
>After deployment, the Bing Search connection created via Bicep is **not automatically discoverable** by the AI Foundry Agent, which is a current limitation. You must manually recreate the connection in the Azure AI Foundry Portal:
>
>1. Navigate to [Azure AI Foundry Portal](https://ai.azure.com/)
>2. Open your AI Foundry project (e.g., `project-<resourceToken>`)
>3. Go to **Management Center** ‚Üí **Connected resources**
>4. Delete the existing Bing Search connection
>5. Click **+ New connection** and choose **Grounding with Bing Search**
>6. Choose your existing Bing Search resource (e.g., `bing-<resourceToken>`)
>7. Complete the connection setup
>
>This manual step is required for the **Web Search Agent** to function properly. Without it, web search queries will fail even though the Bing Search resource is deployed and configured.

>[!NOTE]
>AZD will also setup the local Python environment for you, using `venv` and installing the required packages.

## Customization and Iteration

This solution is designed to be easily customizable without requiring complete redeployment of Azure resources:

- To modify and deploy only the frontend components:
  ```sh
  # Make your changes to the frontend code
  azd deploy frontend
  ```

- To modify and deploy only the backend components:
  ```sh
  # Make your changes to the backend code
  azd deploy backend
  ```

These targeted deployments allow for faster development cycles and testing while preserving your Azure resource configuration and data.

Additionally, thanks to Azure Logic Apps' extensive connector ecosystem, the solution offers promising extensibility options. You can easily integrate with hundreds of services and systems such as:
- CRM and business systems (Dynamics 365, Salesforce, etc.)
- Communication platforms (Teams, Slack, SMS)
- Additional database systems
- Enterprise applications and services

This enables you to build complete end-to-end workflows that connect the AI assistant with your existing business processes and data sources without extensive custom coding.

## Local execution

Once the environment has been deployed with `azd up` you can also run the application locally.

Please follow the instructions in [the instructions in `src/frontend`](./src/frontend/README.md)
